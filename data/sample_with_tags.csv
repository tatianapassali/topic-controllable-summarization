"( CNN ) On Friday , ISIS claimed responsibility for Yemen 's deadliest terror attack . A day earlier it claimed responsibility for the worst terror attack in Tunisia . [TAG]Last[TAG] [TAG]week[TAG] it welcomed into the fold Boko Haram , a Nigerian terrorist group with thousands of fanatical fighters that dominates territory the size of New Jersey . John Carver will use his Holland [TAG]World[TAG] [TAG]Cup[TAG] stars to inflict yet more St [TAG]James[TAG] ’ Park misery on Louis van Gaal – and says the Dutchman missed a trick in not [TAG]taking[TAG] Daryl Janmaat with him to Old Trafford . The Manchester United boss has already been on the receiving end of two defeats on Tyneside . All this came in the wake of the group 's rapid expansion across Libya , its assimilation of a powerful Egyptian terrorist group , and the founding of small chapters in Saudi Arabia , Afghanistan , Pakistan and Algeria , where its new affiliate [TAG]last[TAG] [TAG]year[TAG] beheaded a French hiker . First , with Barcelona in 1997 , he was the victim of Tino Asprilla ’ s famous hat-trick in a 3-2 loss in the Champions [TAG]League[TAG] group stages . Ten [TAG]years[TAG] later he was back with AZ Alkmaar as they were beaten 4-2 in the [TAG]last[TAG] 16 of the UEFA [TAG]Cup[TAG] , turning the tie with a 2-0 victory back in Holland . The group 's momentum may have stalled in Syria and Iraq , but its supporters from the Atlantic to the Hindu Kush appear to be heeding its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 's [TAG]call[TAG] to `` erupt volcanoes of jihad . '' By far the most surprising development was its claim of responsibility for the twin suicide bomb blasts that killed over 130 in Houthi-Shia mosques in Sanaa , Yemen , on Friday and another attack in the north . Van Gaal returns with United on Wednesday where he will come up against Janmaat and Tim Krul , two of the [TAG]players[TAG] who helped Holland to the semi-finals of the [TAG]World[TAG] [TAG]Cup[TAG] [TAG]last[TAG] summer . John Carver described Daryl Janmaat ( left ) as an 'exceptional [TAG]player[TAG] ' ahead of Newcastle United 's match . ISIS was only thought to have a fledgling presence in Yemen and had only claimed one previous attack , the assassination of a Yemeni security official north of Aden earlier this month . The Newcastle United boss ( right ) was surprised United did n't [TAG]make[TAG] a move for the impressive full back . And Carver said : ‘ Daryl and Tim have been very helpful in terms of how Van Gaal organises his [TAG]teams[TAG] . Al Qaeda in Yemen , or AQAP , has for [TAG]years[TAG] been the dominant Jihadi group inside Yemen , but it denied involvement in the mosque attacks , saying it was against its principles to target mosques , bolstering the ISIS claim . This indicates ISIS has very quickly built up an operational capability inside Yemen in the months since jihadis inside the country released an audiotape declaring allegiance to Baghdadi [TAG]last[TAG] November . Only two developments could explain this : defections from AQAP or the return home of Yemeni ISIS veterans skilled in urban warfare and explosives . There is no love lost these days between the two groups . ‘ They actually came to me with the advice , which was nice , and it was a helpful insight. ’ He added : ‘ I ’ ve heard his record here isn ’ t very good and he ’ s lost twice , hopefully it will be third [TAG]time[TAG] unlucky . ‘ I was there for that Barcelona [TAG]game[TAG] and I wouldn ’ t mind another night like that. ’ Meanwhile , Carver admits that Newcastle ’ s £5million capture of Janmaat has proved one of the best pieces of business from [TAG]last[TAG] summer . Since Baghdadi declared ISIS had expanded into Yemen late [TAG]last[TAG] [TAG]year[TAG] there has been an escalating war of words between them , with ISIS claiming AQAP was not doing enough to target Houthis and AQAP declaring that the ISIS caliphate was illegitimate . Tim Krul ( left ) and Janmaat have been [TAG]giving[TAG] Carver insight into how Van Gaal sets his sides up . While AQAP has acknowledged previous internal disagreements about whether to support ISIS , there have been relatively few defections . Its charismatic leader , Nasir al-Wuhayshi , al Qaeda 's global number two , is extremely [TAG]popular[TAG] among the group 's rank and file . The 25-year-old was an ever-present in Brazil and , with United short of options on the right side of defence , Carver is surprised Van Gaal did not rival them for his signature . In recent months the group has reaped a recruitment windfall from Sunni tribal anger over the Houthi takeover of Sanaa , allowing it to expand its operations across Yemen . ‘ I think Van Gaal perhaps had more pressing issues to sort out because let 's not forget , when he came in he was talking about [TAG]playing[TAG] with three centre-backs , ’ said Carver . But ISIS appears now to have laid down the gauntlet , declaring its attacks Friday were the `` tip of the iceberg . '' In targeting the Houthi mosques in Sanaa , ISIS would be quite deliberately repeating the sectarian strategy of its founder , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , who launched a devastating suicide bombing on Golden Mosque in Samarra in February 2006 , which plunged Iraq into a full-blown sectarian civil war . ‘ But even as a wing-back Daryl would have fitted into the system nicely . ‘ He 's a top , top [TAG]player[TAG] . We lost a top [TAG]player[TAG] in Mathieu Debuchy but replaced him with an exceptional [TAG]player[TAG] . Al-Zarqawi correctly calculated that the Shia , infuriated by the attack on their most sacred shrines , would violently retaliate , driving Sunnis into the embrace of the jihadis . That 's good news . ‘ He 's been the most consistent [TAG]player[TAG] for us this [TAG]season[TAG] and is a great character . ‘ He is a good defender and likes [TAG]playing[TAG] on the front foot and he [TAG]gives[TAG] you real quality [TAG]going[TAG] forward . The Dutch goalkeeper [TAG]played[TAG] under Van Gaal at the [TAG]World[TAG] [TAG]Cup[TAG] including his heroics in a penalty shoot out . ‘ That 's what we saw when we signed him . Yemen appears now to be on the brink of a similar civil war . He 's second on the list of assists in the Premier [TAG]League[TAG] for defenders and he ’ s been excellent for us. ’ There has been talk of Van Gaal [TAG]making[TAG] a move for Janmaat at the end of the [TAG]season[TAG] . The terrorist attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunisia on Wednesday that killed 23 was the worst terrorist attack on tourists in the Arab [TAG]world[TAG] since the 1997 massacre in Luxor , Egypt . It would also be ISIS ' most spectacular act of international terrorism since it carried out coordinated suicide bombings on American and international hotels in Amman , Jordan , in 2005 . But Tunisia is right on Europe 's doorstep , just 30 miles across the sea from the southern Italian island of Pantelleria . ISIS has so far offered no proof to back up its claim it was responsible . And the former Feyenoord star certainly talks highly of his former international boss . Yet several factors [TAG]give[TAG] the claim credence . Firstly , as of late Friday no other group had claimed responsibility . Secondly , Tunisian investigators have established that two members of the cell that carried out the attack trained in the Derna and Benghazi region of Libya late [TAG]last[TAG] [TAG]year[TAG] . In November , CNN reported that ISIS was running several training camps in the Green Mountains between these two eastern Libyan towns where it was instructing recruits from across North Africa , including Tunisians . ‘ He is a fantastic trainer and he has had a magnificent career , ’ he said . Thirdly , up to 3,000 Tunisians have traveled to Syria and Iraq , many to fight with ISIS . ‘ I have been very fortunate to work with him and I can not say a bad word about him . ‘ He is one of the best trainers I have ever worked with , and if you see how he works tactically , it is great . He always seems to [TAG]know[TAG] what to do to win a game. ’ Louis van Gaal does n't have a good record at St [TAG]James[TAG] ' Park and has lost his [TAG]last[TAG] two [TAG]games[TAG] there . Five-hundred are believed to have returned home , including a significant number of trained killers , skilled in handling automatic weapons . The three most powerful new ISIS affiliates are in Egypt , Libya and Nigeria . [TAG]Last[TAG] November the Egyptian Sinai-based jihadi group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to ISIS . Bolstered by the return home from Syria of Egyptian ISIS veterans , in recent months the group has escalated its campaign of attacks against security forces in the Sinai and across Egypt and has put out its own gory beheading videos . The threat it poses to Western tourists was underlined [TAG]last[TAG] summer when it killed an American oil worker in the deserts southwest of Cairo in a carjacking . In Libya , ISIS is [TAG]taking[TAG] advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand . [TAG]Last[TAG] autumn it established a foothold in eastern Libya , bolstered by the return of 300 Libyan ISIS veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of al-Baghdadi . It is now the dominant force in Derna , has a presence in Benghazi and controls part of the town center in Sirte , on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen Egyptian Christians in February . It also has a growing presence in Tripoli , where its fighters in January carried out an attack on the five-star Corinthia hotel that killed several Westerners . In Nigeria , Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS earlier this month and brought celebrations to the streets of Raqqa , ISIS ' headquarters town in Syria . Boko Haram hopes it will bring a recruitment , fundraising and propaganda windfall . `` The merger with the Islamic State was a strategic , calculated , and long-term decision coming from the top of the Boko Haram leadership and communications structure , '' wrote Jacob Zenn , an expert on the group , in a just released West Point Combating Terrorism Center study on ISIS ' growing array of affiliates . Though military operations by Nigeria and Chad have eroded Boko Haram 's safe haven in northeastern Nigeria in recent [TAG]weeks[TAG] , the group [TAG]still[TAG] has formidable capacity to terrorize the region . A signature tactic : beheading its enemies with chain saws . For reasons of geography , there appear to be fewer organizational ties between ISIS and Boko Haram than between ISIS and its affiliates in Libya and Egypt . `` The numbers of Boko fighters who have fought or trained with ISIS in places such as Syria , Iraq , Turkey , and Libya and returned to Nigeria is believed to be small : fewer than 20 fighters and video-propagandists , '' Zenn , who was recently briefed by Nigerian intelligence officials , told CNN . ISIS ' expansion into the southern shore of the Mediterranean has alarmed European governments . Italian fishermen operating off the south coast of Italy are so concerned they could be targeted by ISIS gunmen launching from Libya in speedboats that they have demanded protection from the Italian navy . Then there is the threat of trained European fighters returning home from the killing fields of Iraq and Syria . Over 3,000 Europeans have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq , many with ISIS . More than 750 have returned . Among their number , according to Belgian counterterrorism officials , was a Belgian terrorist cell dispatched by ISIS from Syria to carry out a major terrorist attack in the heart of Europe . The plot was thwarted when several of the cell were killed in a gunbattle in eastern Belgium in January . European officials told CNN ISIS is increasingly pivoting toward plotting attacks in Europe . There is also concern ISIS could infiltrate non-European Union passport holders into Europe . [TAG]Last[TAG] [TAG]year[TAG] more than a hundred-thousand refugees arrived in Italy from Libya , according to the United Nations . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned Thursday that Europe faced the greatest terrorist threat in its history , the starkest warning yet from a head of a European government since ISIS set up its caliphate in Syria and Iraq . `` The [TAG]problem[TAG] is not if there will be another attempted attack in France and in Europe , but to [TAG]know[TAG] when and where , '' he said .","Newcastle United boss John Carver says his Dutch players have been helping him in his preparation for the game against Louis van Gaal .

Thirdly , up to 3,000 Tunisians have traveled to [TAG]Syria[TAG] and [TAG]Iraq[TAG] , many to [TAG]fight[TAG] with [TAG]ISIS[TAG] . Five-hundred are believed to have returned home , including a significant number of trained killers , skilled in handling automatic weapons . The three most powerful new [TAG]ISIS[TAG] affiliates are in Egypt , Libya and Nigeria . Last November the Egyptian Sinai-based jihadi [TAG]group[TAG] Ansar Beit al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to [TAG]ISIS[TAG] . Bolstered by the return home from [TAG]Syria[TAG] of Egyptian [TAG]ISIS[TAG] veterans , in recent months the [TAG]group[TAG] has escalated its [TAG]campaign[TAG] of [TAG]attacks[TAG] against [TAG]security[TAG] [TAG]forces[TAG] in the Sinai and across Egypt and has put out its own gory beheading videos . The [TAG]threat[TAG] it poses to [TAG]Western[TAG] tourists was underlined last summer when it [TAG]killed[TAG] an [TAG]American[TAG] oil worker in the deserts southwest of Cairo in a carjacking . In Libya , [TAG]ISIS[TAG] is [TAG]taking[TAG] advantage of chaos and simmering civil [TAG]war[TAG] to rapidly expand . Last autumn it established a foothold in eastern Libya , bolstered by the return of 300 Libyan [TAG]ISIS[TAG] veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of al-Baghdadi . It is now the dominant [TAG]force[TAG] in Derna , has a presence in Benghazi and [TAG]controls[TAG] part of the town center in Sirte , on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen Egyptian Christians in February . It also has a growing presence in Tripoli , where its [TAG]fighters[TAG] in January carried out an [TAG]attack[TAG] on the five-star Corinthia hotel that [TAG]killed[TAG] several Westerners . In Nigeria , Boko Haram pledged allegiance to [TAG]ISIS[TAG] earlier this month and brought celebrations to the streets of [TAG]Raqqa[TAG] , [TAG]ISIS[TAG] ' headquarters town in [TAG]Syria[TAG] . Boko Haram hopes it will bring a recruitment , fundraising and propaganda windfall . `` The merger with the [TAG]Islamic[TAG] [TAG]State[TAG] was a strategic , calculated , and long-term decision coming from the top of the Boko Haram leadership and communications structure , '' wrote Jacob Zenn , an expert on the [TAG]group[TAG] , in a just released West Point Combating Terrorism Center study on [TAG]ISIS[TAG] ' growing array of affiliates . Though [TAG]military[TAG] operations by Nigeria and Chad have eroded Boko Haram 's safe haven in northeastern Nigeria in recent weeks , the [TAG]group[TAG] still has formidable capacity to terrorize the region . A signature tactic : beheading its [TAG]enemies[TAG] with chain saws . For reasons of geography , there appear to be fewer organizational ties between [TAG]ISIS[TAG] and Boko Haram than between [TAG]ISIS[TAG] and its affiliates in Libya and Egypt . `` The numbers of Boko [TAG]fighters[TAG] who have [TAG]fought[TAG] or trained with [TAG]ISIS[TAG] in places such as [TAG]Syria[TAG] , [TAG]Iraq[TAG] , [TAG]Turkey[TAG] , and Libya and returned to Nigeria is believed to be small : fewer than 20 [TAG]fighters[TAG] and video-propagandists , '' Zenn , who was recently briefed by Nigerian intelligence officials , told CNN . [TAG]ISIS[TAG] ' expansion into the southern shore of the Mediterranean has alarmed European [TAG]governments[TAG] . Italian fishermen operating off the south coast of Italy are so concerned they could be [TAG]targeted[TAG] by [TAG]ISIS[TAG] gunmen [TAG]launching[TAG] from Libya in speedboats that they have demanded protection from the Italian navy . Then there is the [TAG]threat[TAG] of trained European [TAG]fighters[TAG] returning home from the [TAG]killing[TAG] fields of [TAG]Iraq[TAG] and [TAG]Syria[TAG] . Over 3,000 Europeans have traveled to [TAG]fight[TAG] in [TAG]Syria[TAG] and [TAG]Iraq[TAG] , many with [TAG]ISIS[TAG] . More than 750 have returned . Among their number , according to Belgian counterterrorism officials , was a Belgian [TAG]terrorist[TAG] cell dispatched by [TAG]ISIS[TAG] from [TAG]Syria[TAG] to carry out a major [TAG]terrorist[TAG] [TAG]attack[TAG] in the heart of Europe . The plot was thwarted when several of the cell were [TAG]killed[TAG] in a gunbattle in eastern Belgium in January . European officials told CNN [TAG]ISIS[TAG] is increasingly pivoting toward plotting [TAG]attacks[TAG] in Europe . There is also concern [TAG]ISIS[TAG] could infiltrate non-European Union passport holders into Europe . Last year more than a hundred-thousand refugees arrived in Italy from Libya , according to the [TAG]United[TAG] Nations . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned Thursday that Europe faced the greatest [TAG]terrorist[TAG] [TAG]threat[TAG] in its history , the starkest warning yet from a head of a European [TAG]government[TAG] since [TAG]ISIS[TAG] set up its [TAG]caliphate[TAG] in [TAG]Syria[TAG] and [TAG]Iraq[TAG] . `` The problem is not if there will be another attempted [TAG]attack[TAG] in France and in Europe , but to [TAG]know[TAG] when and where , '' he said .","ISIS was only thought to have a fledgling presence in Yemen, but claims responsibility for bombing there .

The island is now known as James Bond Island , upon which you and a chum can pose back to back with imaginary weapons , echoing the scene from The Man With The Golden Gun of 007 ( Roger Moore ) and the evil Scaramanga ( Christopher Lee ) . But the problem is practically every other visitor who chooses Thailand for their exotic sun , sea and sand holiday wants to sit and be seen in the country 's most famous hotspots too . Griffiths ' body was later discovered in the River Thame on December 24 after a police appeal for his whereabouts . Despite their missing friend , Ali and Bates targeted another address in Wolverhampton , West Midlands , on December 1 and tried to steal another Evoque . But they were foiled when the owner realised the pair had tampered with the diagnostics of the [TAG]car[TAG] , which was worth £28,500 , and that his key fob no longer [TAG]worked[TAG] . It [TAG]gets[TAG] a little crowded , to say the least . The pair were arrested that month and linked to the thefts and attempted theft of the four [TAG]vehicles[TAG] - worth a total of £140,000 .

There 's The Beach , of course , on the island of Ko Phi Phi Lee , as featured in the 2000 film based on the Alex Garland novel and starring Leonardo DiCaprio . A pair of car thieves who stole £110,000 worth of Range Rovers in a sophisticated scam targeting sellers on Autotrader have been jailed . Nathan Bates , 27 , and Liaquat Ali , 29 , were part of a cunning gang who would turn up at addresses of people advertising their vehicles on the classified motoring website and secretly clone their car keys , a court heard . They would then return later on to steal the luxury cars . The duo and accomplice Michael Griffiths , 31 , targeted their first victim on November 3 , 2013 when a Range Rover Sport worth £36,500 was stolen from an address in Redditch , Worcestershire .

We were escorted by [TAG]men[TAG] from the Badr Brigade , the [TAG]biggest[TAG] and best-organized Iranian-backed force fighting ISIS . As we got out of our car , a man wearing a vest with the emblem of the Iraqi Red Crescent beckoned urgently to video journalist Mary Rogers to come inside . Laura Robson has aborted her planned comeback at next week 's Miami Open , having decided her wrist is [TAG]still[TAG] not ready for full on match [TAG]play[TAG] . He led her to a gurney surrounded by four or five [TAG]men[TAG] , some wearing blue disposable surgical gowns , others in dark green military fatigues . The former British No 1 had accepted a wildcard into the qualifying event for the prestigious tournament involving both sexes in South Florida . They were huddled over a man naked to the waist , a thick plastic tube inserted in his side , red with blood , leading to a bottle filling up with more blood . However , she has now handed it back , as looked likely after she posted a [TAG]picture[TAG] of herself on Saturday [TAG]night[TAG] at a fashion exhibition in London . The wounded man -- no one knew his [TAG]name[TAG] -- had been shot in the head , the chest and the leg . Laura Robson attended a fashion event in London as she continues to recover from a wrist injury . The former British No 1 has not [TAG]played[TAG] since having problems with her wrist in Australia last January . Caution has been the watchword for Robson since she underwent surgery on her wrist early last summer . He was motionless . She had hoped to come back at some small events in California last month ahead of Indian Wells this week , but that was postponed for the Miami wildcard . The head doctor , in dark green combat fatigues , told me the man was in critical condition . The next possible target is a WTA event in Colombia next month although seeing will be believing . All the while , the windows of the building shook from the concussion of the bombardment of central Tikrit . From the sound , it was clear that artillery and rocket launchers were nearby . Several other wounded fighters were in the entrance , but their condition was much less grave . Robson is not said to have suffered any major setback in her rehab but the view is that there is no point rushing and doing further long term damage as she is [TAG]still[TAG] only 21 . It is now 14 months since Robson last appeared , at the 2014 Australian Open , where problems in her wrist ligament fully flared up . It will inevitably be a long road back when she manages to regain full fitness . Robson receives treatment on her wrist during the Hobart International in Australia . One , who identified himself as Sadiq , had been shot in the upper thigh , but was fully conscious . He told producer Kareem Khadder he had been shot in central Tikrit that morning , recalling at the [TAG]time[TAG] he was uncertain whether it was shrapnel or a bullet because the fighting was so intense . While Mary and Kareem were doing that interview , I walked around the hospital to [TAG]see[TAG] if there was anything else that might help us put together a report . It was a ramshackle place , it looked like much of the facility had been in a state of neglect for a while , perhaps because until recently it was in no-man 's land . When I [TAG]went[TAG] back to [TAG]see[TAG] where Mary and Kareem were , I was told Mary was down a corridor where an `` operation '' was about to take place . Mary was invited to [TAG]film[TAG] the operation . I found her putting on a surgical gown and blue shoe covers . Several [TAG]men[TAG] rolled a gurney through the corridor in our direction . The same critically wounded man was wheeled into a side room . He never [TAG]made[TAG] it into the operating theater . A different set of doctors or medics started [TAG]working[TAG] on him , pumping air into his lungs , then applying CPR . His chest took a final heave , as the doctors tried to find a pulse , but there was no pulse to find . There was no `` operation . '' This was a last , desperate attempt to stop this unknown man from dying . His face was yellow and waxy . He was dead , but the doctors did n't call [TAG]time[TAG] of death , . In the meantime , our escorts were calling us to leave , we needed to move to our next destination , which they had told us was the position from which artillery and rocket launchers were at [TAG]work[TAG] . Mary , who was at the far end of the gurney , wedged her way out and we [TAG]went[TAG] outside . She [TAG]went[TAG] to the car , I chatted with a pair of Iraqi journalists in the entrance . They had been here for more than two weeks . I bade them farewell , and walked toward our car . And then , [TAG]everything[TAG] changed . I heard a commotion behind me , and the doctor I had spoken to before passed me , shouting , `` Grab all the cameras ! Get the cameras ! '' `` What 's the problem ? '' I asked him . He did n't provide an explanation . `` Give us your cameras now ! '' he barked at me . A group of militiamen had surrounded Kareem , and was insisting he give them his small camera . More militiamen , plus some of the hospital staff gathered around him , shouting angrily that all cameras must be surrendered . Right next to me a tall man with a military shirt over running pants raised his rifle , about to shoot in the air . This is [TAG]going[TAG] to get very messy , I thought to myself . Fortunately , cooler heads prevailed and there was no shooting . But everyone was very agitated . Much shouting ensued between our entourage and the local militiamen . Our chief escort , Ma'in Al-Kadhimi , was gesturing wildly and arguing with them to calm down , but he was n't having much luck . He is a commander of the Badr Organisation , but these [TAG]men[TAG] were with the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade ( Kataib Jund Al-Imam in Arabic ) . It 's a separate group , and clearly Al-Kadhimi , who was treated with deference by his own [TAG]men[TAG] , did n't enjoy the same esteem here . In the meantime , I joined Mary in our car , concerned that too many of us arguing with this large group would only [TAG]make[TAG] matters worse . Kareem was busy negotiating outside the hospital . We locked the car doors and did our [TAG]best[TAG] to pretend we were simply waiting patiently to move . Soon a group of [TAG]men[TAG] armed with AK-47 assault rifles gathered outside the car , knocking on the window and angrily gesturing that we must give them the camera . Mary discreetly pulled out the data card with the footage she had just shot and replaced it with an empty one . It 's an old trick that sometimes [TAG]works[TAG] in situations like these . Although I could understand [TAG]everything[TAG] this crowd was saying , I feigned ignorance . This [TAG]went[TAG] on for about 45 minutes . Some in our entourage were trying to keep the crowd from banging on the car windows and wrenching open the locked doors . Kareem hid his small camera in one of the cars and saw the [TAG]big[TAG] camera being taken away by several [TAG]people[TAG] . Kareem followed the camera to [TAG]make[TAG] sure it was safe . Inside , everyone was shouting , with Kareem refusing to do anything before someone explained what was [TAG]going[TAG] on . The armed [TAG]men[TAG] wanted the sequence of the dying fighter deleted , and were n't [TAG]going[TAG] to take `` no '' for an answer . Kareem then [TAG]went[TAG] inside one of the rooms to carry on negotiations . Armed [TAG]men[TAG] barred Kareem from leaving the room . Eventually , Kareem said we should delete the sequence of the dying man , after our Iraqi security guard had said we needed to do just that -- otherwise , we were in trouble . Kareem looked at the camera and noticed the card was missing . A media-savvy member of the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade insisted we were hiding the card with the footage . Finally Kareem returned and said that if we did n't hand over the camera there would be trouble . The atmosphere was such that we realized that not handing over the camera would [TAG]make[TAG] matters much worse . So we gave Kareem the camera and waited . A few minutes later , he returned . They know the data card is empty . They want the one with the [TAG]pictures[TAG] , he said . So we gave it to him . Soon Kareem was back . `` They do n't know how to delete the [TAG]pictures[TAG] of the dying man , '' he said . So Mary [TAG]went[TAG] with him inside the hospital to delete the footage of the dying man . To cut a long , tense [TAG]story[TAG] short , Mary did n't delete the footage . Someone else did , all the footage from the hospital . After about an hour and a half , we finally left the hospital compound . Our escort , Al-Kadhimi , was shaken . He , and we , were reminded that with all the different armed groups fighting on the Tikrit front , there might be unity against ISIS , but that 's about where it ends .","Former British No 1 has returned a wildcard to the Miami Open as she continues to recover from a wrist injury .
